# Entry 7
##### 5/31/24






### Context
After completing the website, each one of us have to create a slide and present our website infront of whole class, and we also when to an Expo and gave elevator pitch to people who came over and want to know about our website




### In Class presentation




I did great in the hooking part for my slide, and I wanted to have a great hook because a good hook and determine if people will pay attention for your presentation or not, and I show my website and how I got to my website in the slide, and I also added the problem and challenge when making the website




#### Takeaway for In Class Presentation




Should have shown the website in the beginning and not the end, also make eye contact with people, plus I need to add a conclusion not just say "that it" but inside say something like "think you" or "The End". And I learned that don't go last, go in somewhere in the middle, because the longer I wait the more nervous I get, so next time I should just do it early and get over with it.




### Expo Presentation




In the Expo I sat near the main entrance so a lot of people came to my website, and I was happy to show off my website to many people, and I was able to walk around and see how other people's websites look.




#### Takeaway for Expo Presentation




When giving my elevator pitch to other people, I sometimes forget what I have to say to them, and I need to practice next time before the present day comes.


### Engineering Design Process


In this entry I finished the last part of my Engineering Design Process, "communication". I did a lot of communication from the presentation in class to the presentation in the Expo.


### Skills


I had a lot improvement in communion, because I was able to get better as giving the presentation in front of whole class, as before I just read out the text on the slide but now I can explain my website rather than just saying it word for word, and I also learn how to do an elevator pitch.
