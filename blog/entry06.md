When making the MvP you first have to start with a plan. A plan is important 

When making a Mvp for a website, or any other things, you always want to start with a plan. And along with a plan you first have to make a wireframe for your website


### Plan


A plan is important and useful for preparing for the thing you are doing, and you can save all your ideas there and alway look back at your plan to see how you would think about how to make your website. [plan](../prep/plan.md) 


### Process of creating website

First I look at some free tempate on Bootstrap temepatate, And I went and rearch on some way or example how people created their website, and used some of their idea, and my orginal plan and created a website.

### CSS

When creating the website I relised an important css can impact the out come of your website alot, so I put my css in order of each seaction of my html, whatever section came first, I put my css in that order too, so the css wouldn't overlap each other

### Skill

One skill I learn is how to used css and create cool aninations and use css to formate and orginized your website, another skill is to seek help, whenever Im stuck at something, I look back at my note and see if there is a soltion for it, if not I would look back at my old project and see what I did back than, that worked out. For example when I'm trying to create a navbar for my website, it didn't work out no matter how I chnage it, but when I go back to my old porject I relised the Bootstrap link I used was out date and it help me fiex my problem

### Take Away

One of the problem I had was time mannergingment, because whenever I got back home, I uselly get distracted by other stuff and never had time to work on my project, and I sometime also forgot I had a project and I need to find a way to remin myself
