When making the MvP you first have to start with a plan. A plan is important 

When making a Mvp for a website, or any other things, you always want to start with a plan. And along with a plan you first have to make a wireframe for your website


### Plan


A plan is important and useful for preparing for the thing you are doing, and you can save all your ideas there and alway look back at your plan to see how you would think about how to make your website. [plan](../prep/plan.md) 


### Process of creating website

First I looked at some free template on Bootstrap template, And I went and researched some ways for example how people created their website, and used some of their ideas, and my original plan to create a website.

### CSS

When creating the website I released an important css can impact the outcome of your website a lot, so I put my css in order of each section of my html, whatever section came first, I put my css in that order too, so the css wouldn't overlap each other

### EDP

I am at the 7th step of the EDP which is **Improve** the results because there is still many thing on my website I can improve for example the bootstrap, the background, and the animation css to make my website look way more interesting.


### Skill

One skill I learn is how to used css and create cool animations and use css to format and organize your website, another skill is to seek help, whenever Im stuck at something, I look back at my note and see if there is a solution for it, if not I would look back at my old project and see what I did back than, that worked out. For example when I'm trying to create a navbar for my website, it didn't work out no matter how I change it, but when I go back to my old project I realized the Bootstrap link I used was out date and it help me fix my problem

### Take Away

One of the problem I had was time management, because whenever I got back home, I usually get distracted by other stuff and never had time to work on my project, and I sometime also forgot I had a project and I need to find a way to remind myself
