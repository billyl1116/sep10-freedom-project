## Future ideas for gambling
After entry 02 of collecting information about gambling, in entry 3 I brainstormed about the future ideas for gambling, and I searched up information for ideas about what gambling may have in the future.

## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the third stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to brainstorm about future ideas for gambling for their technologies. The topic are **What gambling look like in the future**. The next stage is to research about the technology people are coming up with and some ideas people are working on right now that may happen in the future and I look up on others projects and gain an idea for my ideas.

## Process of Brainstorming 
For brainstorming, first I think about what people have now, and the problem people have, or something that can fix the problem or improve the way people gamble. Afterward I look up on [website and article](https://zybervr.com/blogs/news/5-best-virtual-reality-casinos-gamble-in-vr) for idea people already have or made, and look up at other [people's project](https://benjaminc8190.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) for ideas.

### VR Gambling

1. I believe that in the future people can connect to vr and experienced gambling irl without having to go to casino to do so

2. It’s easier to proven people from cheating using tricks 
* Doing online people can’t cheat using hand trick to cheat
* All Casino worker have to worry about is no one hacking into their system

3. With vr gambling people from different places can group up and do gambling

* Can play with friend in another countries face to face

4. Adding some action and thing to do when gambling 
* Maybe you’re mad that you lost a gamble so you want to do something to take out your anger
* Fling the table
* Throw a tomato at someone’s face
* Pushing people
* (Of course you can’t do that in irl but you can do it in VR.)

### AI gambling helper
1. Having an AI to help you see your gambling history
2. Show you the percentage of winning, by how much you won by betting on your style and the possible outcome

3. Showing you how many money you have left all the time 
4. If you get addicted AI and tell you to stop
Forcefully shutting down your devised
Giving you warning 

## Skills


### Time organization


when doing the brainstorming I need to spend time to organized my note and think about the ideas for the project

When doing the brainstorming I need to go back to my notes, many times to check and gain an idea of how I'm going to write about the future idea.
