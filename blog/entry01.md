## Choosing a topic
For my project, I chose the topic of gambling because I'm really interested in it. When I first started this project, I picked 3 topics in total, which are farming, music, and gambling. And I chose gambling instead of the other two people I think the gambling is way more interesting.
## Why Gambling
just think about it gambling happen everyday in our like, it can be so big like betting all your money in the casino, or betting your future on something, it can be making a company or taking a job or maybe proposal to a girl. Or it can be small, like a bet you make with your friend, or spinning for something in games. What I'm trying to say is **in our life me make a lot of gamblings, either you win or lose, you have to make the gamble, and you can gain something awesome or lose something important, it's something everyone have to go through**, and it's the **beauty of life.**

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study about gambling in order to help me make by website.

## Links
I used an article about ["Casinos all around the world"](https://www.statista.com/topics/1053/casinos/#topicOverview), and article about a ["successful gambler"](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/09/business/earning-it-life-s-a-gamble-a-few-people-make-it-a-profession.html). However the one liked the most was this article about ["the gamble people have to face in their life"](https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/bet-on-yourself-23406310fb03)

## Skills

### Time management
I spend a few minutes every day researching and doing my work.

### How to research
I search up what I'm going to write about and when it give me all the articles, I pick the ones that have the **most fitting topic first**, and I ask people around me or personal experiments to get information I need.

## EDP
Now, I am on the Step 1 of me researching about my topic and the Step 2 researching step of the EDP. At first, I pick what I'm most passionate about. Then, I do more deep research about how I'm going to do the project. I think It's going to take me something until I move on to the next step, because I still have a more to learn.
## Blog
Below you will find my blog about how I made my project.
