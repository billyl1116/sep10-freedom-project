# SEP10 Freedom Project
by Billy Liu

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

## Choosing a topic
For my project, I chose the topic of gambling because I'm really interested in it. When I first started this project, I picked 3 topics in total, which are farming, music, and gambling. And I chose gambling instead of the other two people I think the gambling is way more interesting, just think about it gambling happen everyday in our like, it can be so big like betting all your money in the casino, or betting your future on something, it can be making a company or taking a job or maybe proposal to a girl. Or it can be small, like a bet you make with your friend, or spinning for something in games. What I'm trying to say is in our life me make a lot of gamblings, either you win or lose, you have to make the gamble, and you can gain something awesome or lose something important, it's something everyone have to go thought, and it's the beauty of life.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study about gambling in order to help me make by website.

## Links
I used an article about ["Casinos all around the world"](https://www.statista.com/topics/1053/casinos/#topicOverview), and article about a ["successful gambler"](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/09/business/earning-it-life-s-a-gamble-a-few-people-make-it-a-profession.html). However the one liked the most was this article about ["the gamble people have to face in their life"](https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/bet-on-yourself-23406310fb03)
