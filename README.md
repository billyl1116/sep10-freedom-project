# SEP10 Freedom Project
by Billy Liu

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of gambling because I'm really interested in it. When I first started this project, I picked 3 topic in total, which are farming, music, and gambling. And I choosed gambling instead of the other two people I think the gambling is way more intresting, just think about it gambling happen everyday in our like, it can be so big like betting all your money in the casino, or betting your future on something, it can be making a company or taking a job. Or it can be small, like bet you make with your friend, or spining for something in games. What I'm trying to say is 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **X** in order to help me make by website.
